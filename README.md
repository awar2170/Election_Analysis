# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview 
A hypothetical Colorade Board of Election employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. 

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast. 
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 
3. Calculate the total number of cotes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the precentage of votes each candidate won. 
5. Determine the winner of the elciton based on popular vote. 
6. Calculate the number of votes and the percentages of votes for each county. 
7. Determine which county had the largest number of votes.

## Resources 
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.10.1, Visual Studio Code 1.63.2

## Challenge Overview 
The purpose of the challenge was to replicate similar code from the module to calculate the total number of votes for each county, the percentages of votes for each county, and determine which county had the largest turnout.  This was accomplished by using a for loop with a nested if statement in python that looped through each county name in a empty python dictionary.  The county names were added to the python dictionary by the first argument in the loop that added a unique list of county names as keys in the python dictionary.  The votes for each county were then calculated by
